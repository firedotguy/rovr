import InlineSVG from "@/components/InlineSVG.astro";

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/main.svg" alt="main interface" />

rovr's user interface has several panels that you can navigate between using the keyboard.

### panels

the main panels are:

- pinned folder sidebar: a list of your favorite or frequently accessed folders. (focus with `s`)
- file list: the main panel, showing the files and folders in the current directory.
- preview sidebar: shows a preview of the selected file or folder. (focus with `i`)
- footer: contains three smaller panels:
  - processes list: shows ongoing processes like copying or deleting files. (focus with `f6`)
  - metadata list: displays metadata for the selected item. (focus with `m`)
  - clipboard list: shows items that you have copied or cut. (focus with `c`)

to return focus to the main file list from any other panel, press `esc`.

### toggling panel visibility

you can show or hide panels to customize your view:

- pinned folder sidebar: `shift+s`
- preview sidebar: `shift+i`
- footer (all three panels): `shift+f`

### compact mode

rovr supports compact mode options for smaller terminal windows or when you want to maximize the file list space. compact mode has two separate options that can be enabled independently:

- **buttons**: compacts the action buttons and path input to one line instead of three (default enabled)
  - cozy buttons
   <InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/cozy_buttons.svg" alt="compact buttons disabled" />
  - compact buttons
   <InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/main.svg" alt="compact buttons enabled" />


- **panels**: makes the footer panels smaller to give more room for the file list (default disabled)
  - cozy panels
   <InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/cozy_buttons.svg" alt="compact buttons disabled" />
  - compact panels
   <InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/compact-panels.svg" alt="compact panels enabled" />

To enable compact mode options, set the following in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[interface.compact_mode]
buttons = true  # compact buttons and path input
panels = true   # make panels smaller
```

You can enable either or both options depending on your preferences and terminal size.

### tabs

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/tabs.svg" alt="multiple tabs" />

rovr supports tabs to manage multiple file list views simultaneously.

- create a new tab: `n`
- close the current tab: `w`
- go to the next tab: `ctrl+j`
- go to the previous tab: `ctrl+k`

### help and shortcuts

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/keybind-list.svg" alt="keybind list" />

- view all available keybindings: `?` - this opens a help screen showing all available shortcuts and their functions
