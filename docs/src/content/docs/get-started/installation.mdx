### requirements

- a patched font that supports nerd font icons
  <br />
  if you don't have any supported fonts, get one from
  [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for the best
  experience.
  <br />
  if you prefer to not use a nerd font, you will need to disable the nerd font
  in the config
- a python package installer
  <br />
  you are recommended to use `uv`, as it handles everything for you, like
  installing the python version, a lot faster than what `pipx`, or `pip` would
  take
- an editor with lsp support for toml
  <br />
  only necessary if you want an autocomplete box while configuring rovr.

currently, `rovr` is only on pypi.

#### uv (test run)

```sh
uvx rovr
```

#### uv (install)

```sh
uv tool install --compile-bytecode rovr
```

<Aside type="note">
I highly recommend installing with `--compile-bytecode`, as startup times will be slower (albeit by not that much) if not cached.
</Aside>

#### pipx (install)

```sh
pipx install rovr
```

#### pip (not recommended)

```sh
pip install rovr
```

if successful, you can run

```sh
rovr --version
```

to see the current version installed

![version](/rovr/screenshots/version.png)

the commit hash may not exist, depends on how the package was built, but the version should be correct.

you can then start the installation by just invoking
```sh
rovr
```
If you dont see something like this
<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/install-helper.svg" alt="install helper" />
you can force the install helper by running
```sh
rovr --force-first-launch
```

you can make the changes you want (optionally, hover over certain options to see a tooltip explaining what it does)

once done, you can press the big green button at the end, take a final glance at your config, before it writes it down.

You finally installed rovr!
