let's use the [5W1H framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) to describe rovr and its latest improvements

### what is rovr?

a modern answer to a terminal file explorer, that can be customized to fit your workflow easily, while being aesthetically pleasing. rovr now features advanced **state management**, flexible **compact modes**, and an improved **sort order switcher** for enhanced usability.

### why should I use rovr?

I can't answer this question, but I can answer why you _shouldn't_ use rovr.
<br/>you shouldn't use rovr if

1. you have an existing workflow with any other file explorers (superfile excluded)
   <br/>other file managers like [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) or [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) are amazing file explorers, and rovr cannot compete with their flexibility, extensibility or just raw speed.

2. you hate good looking things
   <br/>honestly, i don't blame you, if you like your terminal to look clean, sure go use your three pane file explorer, or even just use the cli, i don't mind.

### why did I make it?

I had quite some issues with [superfile](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile). it is an amazing project, and you should definitely go check it out.

<br/>however, some issues I had was with its performance. spf does not utilize either threads nor asyncio, everything runs on a single app process, which can lead to plenty of lag when traveling.
<br/>I would've loved to fix these issues, but I don't have any golang background, and I found [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/Textual) as a framework, and really wanted to put my skills to the test.
<br/>so I guess we are here now.
