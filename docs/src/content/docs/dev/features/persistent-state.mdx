title: persistent state
description: how rovr saves and restores your preferences between sessions.
---

rovr includes a state manager that automatically saves your preferences and restores them when you restart the application. this ensures a consistent experience across sessions without needing to reconfigure settings each time.

## what gets saved

the state manager automatically tracks and persists the following preferences:

### panel visibility

rovr remembers which panels you had visible or hidden:
- **pinned sidebar**: whether the sidebar is shown or hidden
- **preview sidebar**: whether the preview panel is displayed
- **footer**: whether the footer (processes, metadata, clipboard) is visible
- **menu wrapper**: whether the action button menu is shown

when you toggle these panels using their keyboard shortcuts, the state is automatically saved.

### sort preferences

your file sorting configuration persists between sessions:
- **sort criteria**: whether you're sorting by name, size, extension, natural order, created time, or modified time
- **sort direction**: ascending or descending order

for more details on sorting, see the [sorting files](/rovr/features/sorting) guide.

## state file location

the state is stored in a `state.toml` file in your rovr configuration directory. you can find this location by running:

```sh
rovr --config-path
```

the state file will be in the same directory as your `config.toml` and `pins.json` files.

## state file structure

the state file uses toml format and looks like this:

```toml
current_version = "0.5.0"
pinned_sidebar_visible = true
preview_sidebar_visible = true
footer_visible = true
menu_wrapper_visible = true
sort_by = "name"
sort_descending = false
```

### fields

- **current_version**: the version of rovr that last saved the state (used for detecting version changes)
- **pinned_sidebar_visible**: whether the pinned sidebar is visible
- **preview_sidebar_visible**: whether the preview sidebar is visible
- **footer_visible**: whether the footer is visible
- **menu_wrapper_visible**: whether the menu wrapper (action buttons) is visible
- **sort_by**: the current sort criteria ("name", "size", "extension", "natural", "created", "modified")
- **sort_descending**: whether files are sorted in descending order

## automatic saving

the state manager saves changes automatically:
- whenever you toggle a panel's visibility
- whenever you change sort criteria or direction
- when rovr exits normally

you don't need to manually save your preferences, everything happens automatically in the background.

## resetting state

if you want to reset to default preferences, you can:

1. delete the `state.toml` file from your configuration directory
2. restart rovr

rovr will automatically create a new state file with default values:
- all panels visible
- sort by name in ascending order
