`rovr` includes a powerful preview sidebar that can display the contents of various filetypes.

### text files

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/preview-file.svg" alt="file preview" />

plain text files are displayed in a text area with syntax highlighting. the language is determined by the file extension. `rovr` supports a wide range of languages.

### unknown/binary files

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/mime-type.svg" alt="mime type detection" />
mime types are automatically obtained using [puremagic](https://pypi.org/project/puremagic) to give you a more accurate information of the file's type. If you additionally have `plugins.file_one` enabled with `plugins.file_one.get_description`, you can view extra information, like how many sections, what type, etc.

### bat plugin

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/preview-file-bat.svg" alt="file preview with bat" />

if you have [`bat`](/rovr/features/plugins#bat) installed and enabled in the `rovr` config, it will be used to display text files with syntax highlighting for much more languages and theming.

### images

<sub>no screenshots, they don't play nicely with svg</sub>

`rovr` can display images directly in the terminal. refer to the [image previews](/rovr/features/image-previews) guide for more details on terminal compatibility and configuration.

### folders

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/preview-folder.svg" alt="folder preview" />

when a folder is selected, the preview panel will show a list of the files and folders inside it, allowing you to see the contents without navigating into it.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you focus on the folder preview, you can navigate in there to open files and folders, letting you skip actually cd-ing into it!
</Aside>

### archives

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/preview-archive.svg" alt="archive preview" />

for archive files (like `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, `.rar`), rovr will display a list of the files and folders contained within the archive.

### pdf

![pdf preview](/rovr/screenshots/preview-pdf.png)

for pdf files, rovr makes use of [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org). you can also scroll through the pdf with your mouse (scrollbars are unavailable for now) or use your keyboard to navigate it.

### svg

{/* no image for now, please TODO: find a way to reduce the size of the PIL object, it being large destroys the performance of the preview panel */}
rovr makes use of [resvg-py](https://pypi.org/project/resvg-py) to render svg files, so you don't need resvg installed on your system -- it automatically previews the svg file for you without any setup

### fonts

![font preview](/rovr/screenshots/preview-font.png)

for font files (like `.ttf`, `.otf`), rovr will display a preview of the font. you can customise the text used in the preview if you want to test extra things
